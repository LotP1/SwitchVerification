This tool uses information from your Nintendo Switch device to generate a token that can be used to verify yourself as a real switch owner.<br>
Use it with a Discord App/Bot in the supported Discord servers to verify yourself.

# Features:
 - generates a token based on hardware values and a user hash
 - doesn't use any internet connection to generate the token
 - currently works with these discord servers:
   - [Ryubing](https://discord.gg/ryujinx)
   - (contact me on discord `lotp` if you would like to add this to your server)

# Credits:
- SwitchBrew wiki for documenting various service API uses in SwitchVerifier.
- devkitPro for the devkitA64 toolchain and libnx support.
